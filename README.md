## WebVR

*In our current day it is increasingly important to have digital access to real world objects and experiences. It is timely you attended this workshop =D.*

Interesting conversation [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WebVR/comments/3e2mes/what_are_the_advantages_of_webvr_over_native_vr/)

Strengths

* Built on (embarrasingly?) accessible foundations of the internet
* Open: Anyone can be an author
* Interconnected: Anyone can access a wide array of existing materials both VR content and regular web content
* Social
* Lightweight: fast iterations of development

Weaknesses

* Bottlenecks: Memory and cpu/gpu processing power is limited

**Important**

"get it right in black and white" -- Maureen Stone

Frequently it is a limitation in the design rather than the technology that ends up being an issue with Virtual Reality, therefore perhaps do your development initially in WebVR and if pitfalls occur switch

*Caveat if it is clear from start that performance bottlenecks will exist, perhaps not*


## Aframe

[Examples](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/)

[Aframe School](https://aframe.io/school/) <--excellent resource!

Aframe is

* A markup language for Virtual Reality similar to html the backbone of the web
* An Entity Component System, meaning VR elements are relatively easier to create and share than in other systems (Unity, Unreal) 
    * Geared towards beginners who want to get up and running
* A wonderful partner to [glitch.com](https://glitch.com)
